Annual Report
=============

This is the first annual report of the Django Software foundation. It covers
the calendar year of 2013. This report summarizes the finances and activities
of the Django Software Foundation an independent foundation.

Board of Directors
------------------

Ending 2013, the Board of Directors were:

* Adrian Holovaty
* Jeremy Dunck
* Karen Tracey
* Russell Keith-Magee (President)

Officers:

* Andy McKay (Secretary)
* Joseph Kocherhans (Treasurer)

Alex Gaynor served on the board until June of 2013. At that time, Jeremy Dunck
moved from secretary to the board and Andy McKay joined as secretary.

Policies and work
-----------------

Trademark
~~~~~~~~~

A license for the `Django Trademark`_ was completed and posted. The license allows the use of the Django trademark under certain circumstances, whilst protecting the project.

Code of conduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `code of conduct`_ for the Django
community was `created and adopted`_.
The code of conduct allows us to best keep with some of our core values:
documentation and "explicit is better than implicit". We want to maintain a
vibrant, diverse, and technically excellent community, and we believe that a
part of that is writing down the standards of behavior we hold ourselves to.

To deal with violations to the code, a `code of conduct committee`_ was
formed.

Travel grants committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `travel grant committee`_
is formed to provide travel grants for Django conferences, sprints and other
events that require travel from community members.

In 2013, it provided travel grants to attendees of DjangoCon US and DjangoCon
EU.

Malcolm Tredinnick Award
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In March of 2013, the Django community was saddened by the passing of Malcolm
Tredinnick. Malcolm was a long-time contributor to Django, model community
member, brilliant, considerate and patient. He will be missed by the whole
community.

The Django Software Foundation created a fund in Malcolm's honour, the Malcolm
Tredinnick Memorial Prize. This will be a monetary prize, awarded annually, to
the person who best exemplifies the spirit of Malcolmâ€™s work - someone who
welcomes, supports and nurtures newcomers; freely gives feedback and assistance
to others, and helps to grow the community. The hope is that the recipient of
the award will use the award stipend as a contribution to travel to a community
event -- a DjangoCon, a PyCon, a sprint -- and continue in Malcolm's footsteps.

The first winner of the prize, chosen by members of the Django Software,
Foundation was Curtis Maloney.

Tax status
----------

In November 2013 it was found that the 501(c)(3) status for Django Software
Foundation had been revoked in May of 2012. This wasn't reported
until May 2013 and the foundation was never notified. The cause was a late
filing of three successive tax statuses.

Re-instatement of the 501(c)(3) status is underway and Joseph, with the
assistance of the board is working to ensure that this reinstatement happens in
2014.
