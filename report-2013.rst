Malcolm Tredinnick Award
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In March of 2013, the Django community was saddened by the passing of Malcolm
Tredinnick. Malcolm was a long-time contributor to Django, model community
member, brilliant, considerate and patient. He will be missed by the whole
community.

The Django Software Foundation created a fund in Malcolm's honour, the Malcolm
Tredinnick Memorial Prize. This will be a monetary prize, awarded annually, to
the person who best exemplifies the spirit of Malcolmâ€™s work - someone who
welcomes, supports and nurtures newcomers; freely gives feedback and assistance
to others, and helps to grow the community. The hope is that the recipient of
the award will use the award stipend as a contribution to travel to a community
event -- a DjangoCon, a PyCon, a sprint -- and continue in Malcolm's footsteps.

With the help of the community and generous donation from Malcolm's family the
prize fund had $xxx in it by the end of 2013.

The first winner of the prize, chosen by members of the Django Software,
Foundation was Curtis Maloney.
